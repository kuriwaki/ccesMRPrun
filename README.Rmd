This is a set of functions to facilitate running MRP models on CCES data and is a companion to [`ccesMRPprep`](www.shirokuriwaki.com/ccesMRPprep).

To install,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("kuriwaki/ccesMRPrun")
```

The **main functions** in this package are:

1.  `fit_brms` for fitting a multilevel model (or `fit_brms_binomial`)
2.  `poststrat_draws` for extracting posterior draws for each area
3.  `summ_sims` for obtaining summary statistics from these draws
4.  `scatter_45` for clearly visualizing the relationship between the truth and estimate

See below for a demonstration with an example in the state of Georgia.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ccesMRPrun)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Fitting

This is a simple wrapper around `brms::brm` but with some custom priors and a binomial model as a default.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
form <- "response ~ (1|age) + (1 + female |educ) + clinton_vote + (1|cd)"

cc_voters <- filter(cces_GA, vv_turnout_gvm == "Voted")

# turn into counts
fit <- fit_brms(form, cc_voters, verbose = FALSE)

summary(fit)
```

# Poststratification

We can take predicted values from each of the MCMC draws, and aggregate it up to the area of interest.

```{r}
drw <- poststrat_draws(fit, 
                       poststrat_tgt = acs_GA)
drw
```

# Summaries

We often care about the posterior mean and 95 percent credible intervals of the draws.

```{r}
summ_sims(drw)
```

Append the truth and a baseline raw-sample

```{r}
dir_val <- group_by(cc_voters, cd) %>% 
  summarize(p_raw = mean(response, na.rm = TRUE),
            p_ygw = weighted.mean(response, weight_post, na.rm = TRUE), 
            .groups = "drop")

mrp_val <- summ_sims(drw) %>% 
  left_join(distinct(acs_GA, cd, clinton_vote), by = "cd") %>% 
  left_join(dir_val, by = "cd")
```

# Visualization

A wrapper for visualizing the accuracy relationship

```{r mrp-plot, fig.w  = 4, fig.h = 4, fig.align = "center"}
scatter_45(mrp_val, clinton_vote, p_mrp_est, cd,
           xlab = "Clinton Vote",
           ylab = "MRP Estimate")
```

Compare this with raw estimates:

```{r bsl-plot, echo = FALSE}
library(patchwork)
gg_raw <- scatter_45(mrp_val, clinton_vote, p_raw, cd,
                     xlab = "Clinton Vote",
                     ylab = "Raw Average",
                     xlim = c(0.19, 0.85),
                     ylim = c(0.19, 0.85), 
                     expand_axes = FALSE)

gg_ygw <- scatter_45(mrp_val, clinton_vote, p_ygw, cd,
                     xlab = "Clinton Vote",
                     ylab = "Simple Weighted Average",
                     xlim = c(0.19, 0.85),
                     ylim = c(0.19, 0.85),
                     expand_axes = FALSE)

gg_raw + gg_ygw
```
