This is a set of functions to facilitate running MRP models on CCES data
and is a companion to
[`ccesMRPprep`](www.shirokuriwaki.com/ccesMRPprep).

To install,

``` r
remotes::install_github("kuriwaki/ccesMRPrun")
```

The **main functions** in this package are:

1.  `fit_brms()` for fitting a multilevel model (or `fit_brms_binomial`)
2.  `poststrat_draws()` for extracting posterior draws for each area
3.  `summ_sims()` for obtaining summary statistics from these draws
4.  `scatter_45()` for clearly visualizing the relationship between the
    truth and estimate

Steps 1-3 can be done via `mrp_onestep()`.

See below for a demonstration with an example in the state of Georgia.

``` r
library(ccesMRPrun)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Fitting

This is a simple wrapper around `brms::brm` but with some custom priors
and a binomial model as a default.

The two key parts of the workflow is a formula and a data. The formula
should be a brms formula with a binary variable in the outcome. The data
should be individual level data and have all the variables mentioned in
the formula.

``` r
form <- response ~ (1|age) + (1 + female |educ) + clinton_vote + (1|cd)
cc_voters <- filter(cces_GA, vv_turnout_gvm == "Voted")
```

Now fit the model. `fit_brms` is basically the `brm` function, but with
some wrappers.

``` r
fit <- fit_brms(form, cc_voters, verbose = FALSE)
```

``` r
class(fit)
```

# Poststratification

We can take predicted values from each of the MCMC draws, and aggregate
it up to the area of interest.

Here we use the poststratification data to fit *on*. We use the `acs_GA`
built-in data here, but refer to
[`ccesMRPprep`](www.shirokuriwaki.com/ccesMRPprep) to make a data that
is your own.

``` r
drw <- poststrat_draws(fit, poststrat_tgt = acs_GA)
drw
```

    ## 10 GA-01    10 0.412

# Summaries

We often care about the posterior mean and 95 percent credible intervals
of the draws.

``` r
mrp_val <- summ_sims(drw)
```

Append the truth and a baseline raw-sample

``` r
dir_val <- direct_ests(form, cc_voters, 
                       area_var = "cd", 
                       weight_var = "weight_post")

mrp_val <- summ_sims(drw) %>% 
  left_join(elec_GA, by = "cd") %>% 
  left_join(dir_val, by = "cd")
```

# Visualization

A wrapper for visualizing the accuracy relationship

``` r
scatter_45(mrp_val, clinton_vote, p_mrp_est, 
           lblvar = cd,
           ubvar = p_mrp_900,
           lbvar = p_mrp_050,
           xlab = "Clinton Vote",
           ylab = "MRP Estimate ")
```

It may be easier to store the models in long form and show them at once.

``` r
# reshape to long
mrp_long <- mrp_val %>% 
    select(cd, p_mrp_est, p_raw, p_wt, clinton_vote) %>% 
    pivot_longer(-c(cd, clinton_vote), names_to = "model") 

# plot
scatter_45(mrp_long, 
           clinton_vote, 
           value, 
           by_form = ~model,
           by_labels = c(p_mrp_est = "MRP", p_raw = "Raw", p_wt = "YouGov Weighted"),
           xlab = "Clinton Vote",
           ylab = "Estimate")
```
